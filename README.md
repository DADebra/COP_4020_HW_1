## Hello World, But With Spring Boot!

---

Hello World, with a twist: runs a fully-features web application, providing the classic "Hello World" text via REST at the root ("/") page!

Provides the following **SUPER** features:
 1. Returns "Hello World!" with a GET on /
 2. Provides boilerplate code for basic [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) application.
 3. Uses the super-cool, modern, chic build system [Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle).
 4. Gets me a (*hopefully*) good grade!
